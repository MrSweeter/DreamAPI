# DreamAPI

[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dreamapi.41807/)

_(last update 09-03-17 - version 3.0)_

I need API, so I develope it, and I figured why not post it on spigot for those who want. The API is perhaps still limited for the moment, it was made to help me first

More explanations  [here](https://github.com/MrSweeter/DreamAPI/wiki)
